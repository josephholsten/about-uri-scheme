Abstract

   This document specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme
   "about".  About URIs describe resources within a browser or other
   software interpreting URIs.

   This document describes the "about" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme.  About URIs are designed to be an internal, application-level
   identifier.  Unlike many other URI schemes, the resolution of, and
   resources represented by, about URIs is left entirely to each
   individual application.


1.  Introduction

   An about URI is designed to be used internally by applications for
   almost any desired purpose.  Such URIs have commonly been used by web
   browsers for proving access to built-in functionality, such as
   application preferences and settings, information about the
   application, or "easter eggs".


2.  Description

   About URIs provide a namespace for browsers and other URI
   interpreters to expose implementation specific information.  While
   any number of existing schemes could be used to identify such
   resources, about URIs have become the de facto standard.  Browsers
   already use the about scheme.  The about:blank URI is ubiquitous, and
   some browsers also provide other resources with the about scheme,
   including about:cache and about:version.  A frighteningly large list
   of about URIs <http://www.rigaut.com/benoit/CERN/about/>.

   About URIs are also more memorable than an equivalent urn or tag URI.
   Using an http URI would not only be less memorable, but also longer
   and semantically confusing.

   EDITORS NOTE: It may be reasonable to also define an about URN scheme
   and define about URIs as a provisional shorthand for those URNs.

   Some applications need to have identifiers to system resources.  It
   is often reasonable to leave the interpretation of a resource up to
   the implementation.  Generally these will be resources within the
   application.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Contrast these to file URIs

   About URIs are useful because they identify resources the browser
   does not need to retrieve.

   Since about is already in use by most browsers, using an unknown
   about URI as a SYSTEM identifier is generally more compatible with
   SGML parsers than an unknown PUBLIC identifier.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: draft when an application should create a new about
   URI, how to handle unknown about URIs


3.  URI Syntax

   The general syntax of a tag URI, in ABNF [RFC5234] is:

             abouturi = "about:" segment

   where "segment" is imported from [RFC3986].  About URIs are always
   escaped, as per [RFC3986]

   No relative URI syntax is defined.


4.  Resolving About URIs

   In general, applications are free to resolve any about URI to any
   resource, either internal or external, or redirect to an alternative
   URI, with about:blank (Section 3.1) being the only exception.

   As about URIs are designed to be internal to each application, there
   is no expectation of any URI, except about:blank, returning the same
   resource among different applications.  However, it is worth noting
   that some conventions have arisen for providing particular
   functionality via common about URIs.

   The about:blank URI is the only about URI reserved by this
   specification.

4.1.  about:blank

   Applications resolving this URI must return an empty resource,
   containing nothing.

4.2.  Examples

   The following are examples of about URIs that a browser could
   resolve.  They are not guaranteed to be resolvable by every browser.

      about:

      about:blank

      about:sgml-compat

      about:config Commonly provides access to application preferences
      and settings

      about:cache Commonly provides access to information about
      resources stored in the browsers cache.

      about:plugins Commonly provides access to information about
      installed plugins

      about:mozilla An easter egg supported by Mozilla showing a passage
      from the fictional Book of Mozilla

      about:internets An easter egg supported by Google Chrome depicting
      the internet as a series of tubes.


5.  Acknowledgements

   This I-D was made possible thanks to the suggestion [1] of Henri
   Sivonen and the interest [2] of Ian Hickson.  Some points [3] from
   Lachlan Hunt. also points [4] by Larry Masinter.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: add references to historical implementations and
   related work. remove references to discussion. insert information
   about Origin


6.  Security Considerations

   There is no guarantee that an application will understand any about
   URI provided to it.  An about URI may not resolve to the expected
   resource.  If the reference is unlikely to resolve correctly, the
   reference should be accompanied by an explanation or alternatives.

   Some applications are known to display arbitrary HTML following the
   scheme.  Applications should be cautious when accessing an about URI.
   An application should not execute or display information in an about
   URI.  About URIs should not cause the application to modify any data.
   Applications should not use about URIs to access files or other
   sensitive information.

   About URIs may identify resources which show private information.
   This sensitive information should never be included in about URIs.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: convert to use meanings from [RFC2119].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests the IANA permanently register the about
   URI scheme as specified in this document and summarized in the
   following template, per [RFC4395]:

   URI Scheme Name:  about

   Status:  Provisional

   URI Scheme Syntax:  see Section 3

   URI Scheme Semantics:  see Section 2

   Character Encoding Considerations:  percent-encoding is allowed in
      'segment' components (see Section 3)

   Intended usage:  see Section 2

   Applications and/or protocols that use this URI scheme name:  Any
      applications that use URIs as identifiers for private resources,
      such as web browsers.

   Interoperability considerations:  Applications may choose to
      interpret about URIs differently.  About URIs should only be
      expected to work correctly within the same application.

   Security considerations:  see Section 6

   Relevant publications:  none
