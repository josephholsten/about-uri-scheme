    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme "about". About URIs are designed to be an internal, application-level identifier.  Unlike many other URI schemes, the resolution of, and resources represented by, about URIs are left entirely to each individual application.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>An about URI is designed to be used internally by applications for almost any desired purpose.  Such URIs have commonly been used by web browsers for proving access to built-in functionality, such as application preferences and settings, information about the application, or "easter eggs".</t>
      <t>About URIs are more memorable than an equivalent urn or tag URI. Using an http URI would not only be less memorable, but also longer and semantically confusing.  While any number of existing schemes could be used to identify such resources, about URIs have become the de facto standard. Browsers already use the about scheme. The <xref target="blank">about:blank</xref> URI is ubiquitous, and some browsers also provide other resources with the about scheme, including those in <xref target="examples" />.<cref anchor="NOTE-1" source="JH">It may be reasonable to also define an about URN scheme and define about URIs as a provisional shorthand for those URNs.</cref></t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="syntax" title="URI Syntax">
      <figure>
        <preamble>The general syntax of a about URI, in <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref> is:</preamble>
        <artwork type="abnf">
          abouturi = "about:" segment
        </artwork>
        <postamble>where "segment" is imported from <xref target="RFC3986" />. About URIs are always escaped, as per <xref target="RFC3986" />.</postamble>
      </figure>
      <t>No relative URI syntax is defined.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Resolving About URIs">
      <t>In general, applications are free to resolve any about URI to any
      resource, either internal or external, or redirect to an alternative
      URI, with <xref target="blank" format="title" /> being the only exception.</t>
      
      <t>As about URIs are designed to be internal to each application, there
      is no expectation of any URI, except <xref target="blank" format="title" />, returning the same
      resource among different applications.  However, it is worth noting
      that some conventions have arisen for providing particular
      functionality via common about URIs.</t>
      
      <t>Because about URIs identify application specific information, applications should not need to retrieve remote information for such a resource.<cref anchor="NOTE-2" source="JH">draft when an application should create a new about URI, how to handle unknown about URIs</cref></t>

      <t>The <xref target="blank" format="title" /> URI is the only about URI reserved by this
      specification.<cref anchor="NOTE-3" source="JH">Should undefined about URIs redirect to about:blank?</cref></t>
      
      <section anchor="blank" title="about:blank">
        <t>This URI identifies an empty resource. If the application may use a document of MIME type 'text/html' and character encoding 'UTF-8', about:blank SHOULD be represented with an empty document. Other representations are not defined.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="examples" title="Examples">
        <t>
          The following examples illustrate some known URIs supported by existing applications. They are not guaranteed to be resolvable by every application.

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <!-- must play nice with RFC3552 and RFC4949 -->
      <t>There is no guarantee that an application will understand any about URI provided to it. An about URI may not resolve to the expected resource. If the reference is unlikely to resolve correctly, the reference should be accompanied by an explanation or alternatives.</t>      
      <t>Some applications are known to display arbitrary HTML following the scheme.<cref source="JH">see application program in RFC4949</cref> Applications should be cautious when accessing an about URI. An application should not execute or display information in an about URI.<cref source="JH">see active content in RFC4949</cref> About URIs should not cause the application to modify any data. Applications should not use about URIs to access, or erase files or other sensitive information.</t>
      <t>About URIs may identify resources which show sensitive information. This data SHOULD NOT be exposed in about URIs.<cref anchor="NOTE-5" source="JH">convert to use meanings from RFC2119.</cref><cref anchor="NOTE-6" source="LH">insert information about Origin</cref><cref source="JH">see browser in RFC4949</cref>></t>
