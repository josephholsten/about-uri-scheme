    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme "about". About URIs are designed to be an internal, application-level identifier.  Unlike many other URI schemes, the resolution of, and resources represented by, about URIs are left entirely to each individual application.</t>

    <section title="Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)">
       <t>Discussion of this draft should take place on the URI Review mailing list (uri-review@ietf.org).</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>An about URI is designed to be used internally by applications for almost any desired purpose.  Such URIs have commonly been used by web browsers for providing access to built-in functionality, such as application information, preferences, settings, or "easter eggs".</t>
      <t>While any number of existing schemes could be used to identify such resources, about URIs have become the de facto standard. Browsers already use the about scheme. The <xref target="blank">about:blank</xref> URI is ubiquitous, and some browsers also provide other resources with the about scheme, including those in <xref target="examples" />.<cref anchor="NOTE-1" source="JH">It may be reasonable to also define an about URN scheme and define about URIs as a provisional shorthand for those URNs.</cref></t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="syntax" title="URI Syntax">
      <figure>
        <preamble>The general syntax of a about URI, in <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref> is:</preamble>
        <artwork type="abnf">
          abouturi = "about:" segment [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
        </artwork>
        <postamble>where "segment", "query", and "fragment" are imported from <xref target="RFC3986" />.</postamble>
      </figure>
      <t>In the interests of tractability to humans, about URIs SHOULD NOT be minted with percent-encoded parts.  However, the about URI syntax does allow percent-encoded characters in the "pchar" elements defined in <xref target="RFC3986" />.</t>
      <t>No relative URI syntax is defined.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Resolving About URIs">
      <t>In general, applications are free to resolve any about URI to any resource, either internal or external, or redirect to an alternative URI, with <xref target="blank" format="title" /> being the only exception.</t>
      
      <t>As about URIs are designed to be internal to each application, there is no expectation of any URI, except <xref target="blank" format="title" />, returning the same resource among different applications.  However, it is worth noting that some conventions have arisen for providing particular functionality via common about URIs.</t>
      
      <t>Because about URIs identify application specific information, applications SHOULD NOT need to retrieve remote information for such a resource.<cref anchor="NOTE-2" source="JH">draft when an application SHOULD create a new about URI, how to handle unknown about URIs</cref></t>

      <t>The <xref target="blank" format="title" /> URI is the only about URI reserved by this specification.<cref anchor="NOTE-3" source="JH">Should undefined about URIs redirect to about:blank?</cref></t>
      
      <section anchor="blank" title="about:blank">
        <t>Applications resolving this URI MUST return an empty resource, with the media type "text/html" and the character encoding "UTF-8".</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="examples" title="Examples">
        <t>
          The following examples illustrate some known URIs supported by existing applications. They are not guaranteed to be resolvable by every application.
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="about:config">Commonly provides access to application preferences and settings</t>
          <t hangText="about:cache">Commonly provides access to information about resources stored in the browsers cache.</t>
          <t hangText="about:plugins">Commonly provides access to information about installed plugins</t>
          <t hangText="about:mozilla">An easter egg supported by Mozilla showing a passage from the fictional Book of Mozilla</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>Applications are also permitted to redirect such URIs.  For example, Opera redirects all about: URIs, with the exception of about:blank, to the equivalent URI using their internal opera: scheme. e.g. about: config redirects to opera:config.</t>
        <t>This is not an exhaustive list.  Many more are supported by numerous applications.  For more examples, consult <xref target="wikiabout">Wikipedia's entry on the "about: URI Scheme"</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <!-- must play nice with RFC3552 and RFC4949 -->
      <t>About URIs SHOULD NOT cause the application to modify any data. Applications SHOULD NOT use about URIs to access or erase files or other sensitive information.</t>
      <t>About URIs MAY identify resources which show sensitive information. Applications SHOULD ensure appropriate restrictions are in place to protect such information from access or modification by untrusted sources.</t>
      <t>The HTML representation of the URI about:blank MUST use the origin and the effective script origin as defined by <xref target="W3C.WD-html5">HTML5 Section 5.4 Origin</xref>. The origin of the about:blank Document is set when the Document is created. If the new browsing context has a creator browsing context, then the origin of the about:blank Document is the origin of the creator Document. Otherwise, the origin of the about:blank Document is a globally unique identifier assigned when the new browsing context is created.<cref anchor="NOTE-5" source="JH">Should this origin policy apply to all HTML representations?</cref></t>
    </section>
    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <!-- must play nice with RFC2434, RFC4395 -->
      <t>This specification requests the IANA permanently register the 
      about URI scheme as specified in this document and summarized in
      the following template, per <xref target="RFC4395" />:</t>
