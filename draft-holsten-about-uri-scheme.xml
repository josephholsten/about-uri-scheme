		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t>This document specifies the <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI scheme, that may be used by
			   the applications for almost any desired purpose, such as providing
			   access to application information, settings, preferences, and even so
			   called "Easter eggs" (i. e. intentional hidden message, in-joke or
			   feature in the application; see [EASTER-EGGS]).  It does not put any
			   limit on the type of the information, it designates the access to.</t>

			<t>While any number of existing schemes could be used to identify such
			   resources, <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI has become the de facto standard.  The <spanx style="verb">about</spanx>
			   URI scheme has been used by many applications for quite a long time
			   informally. They include such well-known browsers as Microsoft
			   Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari as well as less popular
			   Google Chrome, Konqueror and many others.  However during this time
			   the <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI scheme have not been given any specification, either
			   published as RFC or in any other way.  This document is to remove
			   such uncertainty and give this scheme an official specification and
			   registration.  It also established the IANA registry for <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs
			   segment tokens.</t>
        </section>
		<section title="Terminology">
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
			   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
			   this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="syntax" title="URI Syntax">
			<figure>
				<preamble>The general syntax of an <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI takes the form of <spanx style="verb">abouturi</spanx>
				   rule below, that is defined using <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref>:</preamble>
				<artwork type="abnf">
    abouturi = "about:" segment [ "?" query ]
</artwork>
				<postamble>where <spanx style="verb">segment</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">query</spanx> are defined in <xref target="RFC3986" />.</postamble>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section anchor="encoding" title="Encoding Considerations">
			<t>Because many characters are not permitted with the syntax, described above, the
			   <spanx style="verb">segment</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">query</spanx> elements
			   MAY contain characters from the <xref target="UCS">Unicode Character Set</xref> as
			   suggested by <xref target="RFC3986">URI</xref>, by first encoding those characters
			   as octets to the <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8 character encoding</xref>; those
			   octets that correspond to characters in the <xref target="RFC3986">unreserved set</xref>
			   SHOULD be percent-encoded.</t>

			<t>By using UTF-8 encoding, there are no known compatibility issues with mapping
			   Internationalized Resource Identifiers to <spanx style="verb">about</spanx>
			   URIs according to <xref target="RFC3987"/>. Since <spanx style="verb">about</spanx>
			   URIs do not use domain names, <spanx style="verb">ireg-name</spanx> conversion is
			   unnecessary.</t>

		</section>
		<section title="Resolving &quot;about&quot; URIs">
			<t>All <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs are categorised in three ways:
				<list style="hanging">
					<t hangText="Reservation">A reserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI is one that is
					   claimed and defined by a specification for use in a specific context.</t>
					<t hangText="Resolution">Reserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs MAY be defined as
					   resolvable, meaning that they resolve to a defined resource, even outside of their
					   defined usage context.</t>
					<t hangText="Recognition">This relates to whether or not a given application recognises a given
					   URI and knows how to resolve it to a particular resource.</t>
				</list>
			</t>

			<t>The division of <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs into the reservation and resolution categories is per-fact
			   while the recognition per-application.  Therefore, while an <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI may be classified
		       as, for example, reserved and resolvable, it may be not be recognized by all applications.</t>

	        <section title="Reservation">
				<t>A reserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI is one that is claimed and defined by a
				   specification for use in a specific context.  A reserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx>
				   URI MUST be defined as either resolvable or unresolvable.</t>

				<t>An unreserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI is any other <spanx style="verb">about</spanx>
				   URI that is not defined by a specification for use in a specific context, but which MAY be recognized
				   by an application.</t>

				<section anchor="blank" title="about:blank">
					<t>The <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI with the segment equal to
					   <spanx style="verb">blank</spanx> and no query component is reserved by this
					   specification as resolvable. i.e. <spanx style="verb">about:blank</spanx>. Applications
					   resolving the URI <spanx style="verb">about:blank</spanx> MUST return a resource
					   of zero length, containing no data, with the media type <spanx style="verb">text/html</spanx>
					   and the character encoding "UTF-8".</t>

					<t>Note: If a query component is provided with <spanx style="verb">about:blank</spanx>,
					   such as <spanx style="verb">about:blank?</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">about:blank?foo</spanx>,
					   then the URI is not considered to be reserved by this specification.</t>
                </section>
			</section>

			<section title="Resolution">
				<t>A reserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI defined as resolvable means that a
				   conforming implementation must resolve the given URI as defined in any context.</t>

				<t>For example, if a web browser recognises a reserved and resolvable URI, and a user
				   enters that URI into the address bar, the web browser would resolve the URI and return
				   the resource to the user, as defined by the specification that reserved it.</t>

				<t>A reserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI defined as unresolveable means that
				   there is no defined resolution process for the URI that applies outside of the specific
				   context for which it is reserved.  An implementation MAY attempt to resolve the URI in an
				   implementation-specific manner.</t>

				<t>For example, the about:legacy-compat URI that is reserved by <xref target="HTML">HTML</xref>
				   for use in a legacy-parser compatible HTML DOCTYPE is defined as unresolveable.  If a user
				   enters it into the address bar of their browser, the browser MAY return any implementation-specific
				   resource.</t>
			</section>
			
			<section title="Recognition">
				<t>A recognised <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI is an <spanx style="verb">about</spanx>
				   URI that recognized by an application.  Applications that recognise reserved and resolvable
				   URIs MUST use the defined resolution process.  Applications that recognise unreserved or
				   unresolvable URIs MAY resolve the URI in an implementation-specific manner.</t>

				<t>Applications MAY recognise and resolve any unreserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI,
				   or any reserved but unresolvable <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI used outside of its defined
				   context, to any resource, either internal or external, or redirect to an alternative URI.</t>

				<t>An unrecognized <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URI is an <spanx style="verb">about</spanx>
				   URI that is not recognized by an application.  Applications SHOULD resolve unrecognized
				   <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs in the same way as "<xref target="blank" format="title" />".</t>

				<t>Note: As <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs are designed to be internal to each
				   application, there is no expectation of any unreserved or unresolvable URI returning the
				   same resource among different applications. However, it is worth noting that some
				   conventions have arisen for providing particular functionality via common
				   <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs.</t>

				<t>Historical note: Early versions of Netscape and Microsoft Internet
				   Explorer resolved unreserved <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs in the following way: they
				   just displayed the text after "about:", treating it as HTML document.
				   However currently these applications refused such behavior.</t>

			</section>
			
			<section anchor="examples" title="Examples">
				<t>The following examples illustrate some known URIs supported by existing applications. They are not guaranteed to be resolvable by every application.
					<list style="hanging">
						<t hangText="about:config">Commonly provides access to application preferences and settings</t>
						<t hangText="about:cache">Commonly provides access to information about resources stored in the browsers cache.  Current Mozilla Firefox implementations also accept a query string to specify a specific device to show more information about. e.g. about:cache?device=offline provides details about the offline cache.</t>
						<t hangText="about:plugins">Commonly provides access to information about installed plugins</t>
						<t hangText="about:mozilla">An easter egg supported by Mozilla showing a passage from the fictional Book of Mozilla</t>
					</list></t>
				<t>Applications are also permitted to redirect such URIs. For example, Opera redirects all <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs, with the exception of <spanx style="verb">about:blank</spanx>, to the equivalent URI using their internal <spanx style="verb">opera:</spanx> scheme. e.g. <spanx style="verb">about:config</spanx> redirects to <spanx style="verb">opera:config</spanx>.</t>
				<t>This is not an exhaustive list.  Many more are supported by numerous applications. For more examples, consult <xref target="wikiabout">Wikipedia's entry on the "about: URI Scheme"</xref>.</t>
			</section>
        </section>

		<section title="Normalization">
			<t><spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs use the standard <xref target="RFC3986">URI normalization rules</xref>, specifically Simple String Comparison, Case Normalization, and Percent-Encoding Normalization. For example, <spanx style="verb">about:blank</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">about:blan%6B</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">about:blan%6b</spanx> are equivalent, though the percent-encoded forms are discouraged. Due to the structure of <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs, some normalizations do not apply, specifically Syntax-Based Normalization, Scheme-Based Normalization, and Protocol-Based Normalization. For example, <spanx style="verb">about:blank</spanx> is not equivalent to <spanx style="verb">about:BLANK</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">about:blank?</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">about:blank:</spanx>, each MAY represent a different resource. Similarly, <spanx style="verb">about:blank%3F</spanx> is not equivalent to <spanx style="verb">about:blank?</spanx>.</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
			<!-- must play nice with RFC3552 and RFC4949 -->
			<t><spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs might identify resources that reveal sensitive information. Applications SHOULD ensure appropriate restrictions are in place to protect such information from access or modification by untrusted sources.</t>
			<t>Implementations SHOULD also take note of the security considerations described by <xref target="RFC3986" />.  In particular, the following issues SHOULD be considered:</t>
			<t><list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="Reliability and Consistency:">Implementations are responsible for the reliability and consistency of the resources returned.  However, implementations SHOULD take care with <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs that might redirect to, or otherwise return a resource that might subsequently access, remote resources, which might not be reliable or consistent.</t>
				<t hangText="Malicious Construction:">Implementations SHOULD take care to prevent the construction of <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs that might inadvertently perform damaging local or remote operations, such as the modification of data, or leaking of data to untrusted resources.  For example, incorporating unsanitised data provided by the user via the query string into the resulting page could allow attackers to inject scripts into pages, similar to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.</t>
				<t hangText="Sensitive Information:">Implementations SHOULD avoid including sensitive information, such as passwords, within <spanx style="verb">about</spanx> URIs.</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>The security considerations for Rare IP Address Formats and Semantic Attacks, as discussed by <xref target="RFC3986" /> do not apply to about URIs, as they do not contain either IP addresses nor userinfo components.</t>

		<section title="IANA Considerations">
			<!-- must play nice with RFC2434, RFC4395 -->
