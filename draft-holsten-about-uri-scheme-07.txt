                  <draft-holsten-about-uri-scheme-07>

Abstract

   This document specifies the 'about' URI scheme, that may be used by
   the applications for almost any desired purpose, such as providing
   access to application information, settings, preferences, etc.  This
   URI scheme has been used by many web browsers for quite a long time
   informally, i. e. without being documented; this document is to
   remove such uncertainty and give this scheme an official
   specification.

Internet-Draft           The 'about' URI scheme           March 19, 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the 'about' URI scheme, that may be used by
   the applications for almost any desired purpose, such as providing
   access to application information, settings, preferences, and even so
   called "Easter eggs" (i. e. intentional hidden message, in-joke or
   feature in the application; see [EASTER-EGGS]).  It does not put any
   limit on the type of the information, it designates the access to.  

   While any number of existing schemes could be used to identify such
   resources, 'about' URI has become the de facto standard.  The 'about'
   URI scheme has been used by many applications for quite a long time
   informally.  they include such well-known browsers as Microsoft
   Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari as well as less popular
   Google Chrome, Konqueror and many others.  However during this time
   the 'about' URI scheme have not been given any specification, either
   published as RFC or in any other way.  This document is to remove
   such uncertainty and give this scheme an official specification and
   registration.  It also established the IANA registry for 'about' URIs
   segment tokens.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  URI Syntax

   The general syntax of an 'about' URI takes the form of <abouturi>
   rule below, that is defined using ABNF [RFC5234]:

   abouturi = "about:" segment [ "?" query ]

   where <segment> and <query> are defined in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].


3.  Encoding Considerations

   Because many characters are not permitted with the syntax, described
   above, the <segment> and <query> elements MAY contain characters from
   the Unicode Character Set [UCS] as suggested by RFC 3986 [RFC3986],
   by first encoding those characters as octets to the UTF-8 character
   encoding [RFC3629]; those octets that correspond to characters in the
   unreserved set [RFC3986] SHOULD NOT be percent-encoded.

   By using UTF-8 encoding, there are no known compatibility issues with

Internet-Draft           The 'about' URI scheme           March 19, 2011


   mapping Internationalized Resource Identifiers to 'about' URIs
   according to [RFC3987].  Since 'about' URIs do not use domain names,
   "ireg-name" conversion is unnecessary.


4.  Resolving "about" URIs

   All 'about' URIs are split into two groups: reserved and unreserved. 
   A reserved 'about' URI is one that is claimed to be used for a
   specific purpose, which MAY also be defined to be resolvable.  An
   unreserved 'about' URI is any other 'about' URI that is not claimed
   to be used for a specific purpose, but which MAY be recognized by an
   application.

   Another, higher-level, classification is splitting them into
   recognized and unrecognized URIs.  A recognized 'about' URI is an
   'about' URI that is recognized by the application and may be
   resolved.  An unrecognized 'about' URI is an 'about' URI that is not
   recognized by an application and cannot be resolved.  Either reserved
   or unreserved 'about' URI MAY be recognized or unrecognized for the
   specific application.

   The division of 'about' URIs into reserved and unreserved is per-fact
   while classification them into recognized and unrecognized is per-
   application.  Therefore, while an 'about' URI may be classified only
   as reserved or unreserved, it may be recognized by one application
   and unrecognized for the other one.

   The resolving procedures for 'about' URIs are described below.

4.1. Recognized 'about' URIs

   The following rules apply to resolving recognized 'about' URIs.

4.1.1.  Reserved "about" URIs

   The reserved 'about' URIs, if they are defined to be resolvable,
   SHALL be resolved to the application's internal web page or other
   resource, according to the specific <segment> of such URI.  This
   document specifies 3 reserved 'about' URIs.  Other reserved 'about'
   URIs MAY be specified to be reserved by adding the corresponding
   entry to the IANA registry for 'about' URIs segment tokens. 
   Applications attempting to resolve reserved 'about' URIs that are not
   defined to be resolvable, MAY treat such URIs as being unreserved.

   Please note that the 'about' URIs described below are NOT REQUIRED to
   be implemented by applications, compatible with this specification.

Internet-Draft           The 'about' URI scheme           March 19, 2011


4.1.1.1.  about:blank

   The 'about' URI with the segment equal to "blank" and no query
   component is reserved by this specification.  Applications resolving
   the URI "about:blank" SHOULD return a blank HTML document with the
   media type "text/html" and character encoding "UTF-8".  Such document
   should not necessarily be of zero length - it SHALL just represent
   the blank page (e. g. Microsoft Internet Explorer resolves an
   "about:blank" URI to the web page of following contents:
   "<html></html>").

4.1.1.2.  about:legacy-compat

   The 'about' URI with the segment equal to "legacy-compat" and no
   query component is reserved by this specification, per HTML 5 Markup
   Reference [HTML5-MARKUP].  The "about:legacy-compat" URI is an
   unresolvable address defined there intended for use in the DOCTYPE
   designed for compatibility with some legacy authoring tools, such as
   XSLT, which may not be capable of outputting the more common, shorter
   alternative that lacks both the PUBLIC and SYSTEM identifiers.  See
   [HTML5-MARKUP] for details.

4.1.1.3.  about:srcdoc

   The 'about' URI with the segment equal to "srcdoc" and no query
   component is reserved by this specification, per HTML 5 Markup
   Reference [HTML5-MARKUP].  The "about:srdoc" URI is an unresolvable
   address defined there intended to be the address navigated to within
   iframes whose content comes from the srcdoc attribute.  See [HTML5-
   MARKUP] for details.

4.1.2.  Unreserved "about" URIs

   Applications MAY resolve any unreserved "about" URI to any resource,
   either internal or external, or redirect to an alternative URI.  

   Note: As 'about' URIs are designed to be internal to each
   application, there is no expectation of any unreserved URI returning
   the same resource among different applications.  However, it is worth
   noting that some conventions have arisen for providing particular
   functionality via common 'about' URIs.

   Historical note: Early versions of Netscape and Microsoft Internet
   Explorer resolved unreserved 'about' URIs in the following way: they
   just displayed the text after "about:", treating it as HTML document.
   However currently these applications refused such behavior.

4.2.  Unrecognized "about" URIs
 


Holsten, et al.        Expires September 20, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           The 'about' URI scheme           March 19, 2011


   Applications SHOULD resolve unrecognized, either reserved or
   unreserved, 'about' URIs in the same way as "about:blank".


5.  Examples

   The following examples illustrate some known URIs supported by
   existing applications.  They are not guaranteed to be resolvable by
   every application.

   about:config  Commonly provides access to application preferences and
      settings

   about:cache  Commonly provides access to information about resources
      stored in the browsers cache.  Current Mozilla Firefox
      implementations also accept a query string to specify a specific
      device to show more information about. e.g.
      about:cache?device=offline provides details about the offline
      cache.

   about:plugins  Commonly provides access to information about
      installed plugins

   about:mozilla  An "Easter egg" supported by Mozilla showing a passage
      from the fictional Book of Mozilla [MOZILLA-BOOK]

   Applications are also permitted to redirect such URIs.  For example,
   Opera redirects all "about" URIs, with the exception of
   "about:blank", to the equivalent URI using their internal "opera:"
   scheme. e.g. "about:config" redirects to "opera:config".

   This is not an exhaustive list.  Many more are supported by numerous
   applications.  For more examples, consult Wikipedia's entry on the
   "about: URI Scheme" [WIKIABOUT].

Internet-Draft           The 'about' URI scheme           March 19, 2011


6.  Normalization

   "about" URIs use the standard URI normalization rules [RFC3986],
   specifically Simple String Comparison, Case Normalization, and
   Percent-Encoding Normalization.  For example, "about:blank",
   "about:blan%6B" and "about:blan%6b" are equivalent, though the
   percent-encoded forms are discouraged.

   Note that these normalization rules apply only to the case of
   application built-in resolution of 'about' URIs, i. e.
   "about:blan%6B" and "about:blank" SHALL be resolved in the same way. 
   Other cases of these URIs usage would require other normalization
   rules.


7.  Security Considerations

   "about" URIs might identify resources that reveal sensitive
   information.  Applications SHOULD ensure appropriate restrictions are
   in place to protect such information from access or modification by
   untrusted sources.

   Implementations SHOULD also take note of the security considerations
   described by RFC 3986 [RFC3986].  In particular, the following issues
   SHOULD be considered:

   Reliability and Consistency:  Implementations are responsible for the
      reliability and consistency of the resources returned.  However,
      implementations SHOULD take care with 'about' URIs that might
      redirect to, or otherwise return a resource that might
      subsequently access, remote resources, which might not be reliable
      or consistent.

   Malicious Construction:  Implementations SHOULD take care to prevent
      the construction of 'about' URIs that might inadvertently perform
      damaging local or remote operations, such as the modification of
      data, or leaking of data to untrusted resources.  For example,
      incorporating unsanitised data provided by the user via the query
      string into the resulting page could allow attackers to inject
      scripts into pages, similar to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
      attack.

   Sensitive Information:  Implementations SHOULD avoid including
      sensitive information, such as passwords, within 'about' URIs.

   The security considerations for Rare IP Address Formats and Semantic
   Attacks, as discussed by [RFC3986] do not apply to about URIs, as
   they do not contain either IP addresses nor <userinfo> components.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1. URI Scheme Registrations

   This specification requests the IANA register the 'about' URI scheme
   as specified in this document and summarized in the following
   template, per RFC 4395 [RFC4395]:

     URI scheme name:  about

     Status:  Permanent

     URI scheme syntax:  See RFC XXXX, Section 3

     URI scheme semantics:  See RFC XXXX, Section 1

     Encoding considerations:  General encoding considerations described
     in RFC 3986 [RFC3986] for <segment> and <query> parts apply to
     'about' URIs as well.  Internationalization is handled by IRI
     processing [RFC3987].  See also Section 4 of RFC XXXX.

     Intended usage:  An "about" URI is designed to be used internally
     by applications for almost any desired purpose.  See RFC XXXX,
     Section 1

     Applications and/or protocols that use this URI scheme name:  Any
     applications that use URIs as identifiers for private internal
     resources, mostly web browsers.

     Interoperability considerations:  None.

     Security considerations:  Applications SHOULD ensure appropriate
     restrictions are in place to protect sensitive information that
     might be revealed by 'about' URIs from access or modification by
     untrusted sources.  See RFC XXXX, Section 7.

8.2. IANA Registry for 'about' URIs Segment Tokens

   IANA is asked to create and maintain the registry called "'about'
 


Holsten, et al.        Expires September 20, 2011               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           The 'about' URI scheme           March 19, 2011


   URIs Segment Tokens" following the guidelines below.

   The registry's entries consist of 1 field, called "'about' URI
   Segment Token".  The 'about' URI segment token refers to the string
   used in the <segment> part of 'about' URIs, with the syntax described
   in Appendix A of RFC 3986 [RFC3986] for the <segment> rule.  The
   entries in the registry MUST refer only to _reserved_ 'about' URIs,
   as described in this document.

   The registration procedures for this registry are 'First Come First
   Served', described in RFC 5226 [RFC5226].  The registrant of such
   token SHALL also provide the following registration template, that
   SHALL be available on IANA web site:

     'about' URI Segment Token:  REQUIRED field.  Desired 'about' URI
     token, compliant to the syntax described in Appendix A of RFC 3986
     [RFC3986] for the <segment> rule

     Intended Usage:  REQUIRED field.  A short description of intended
     usage of 'about' URI with such segment token

     Resolvable 'about' URI:  REQUIRED field.  Should be "yes" if
     resolvable or "no" if unresolvable

     References:  OPTIONAL field.  References to the document(s), if
     any, that described the registered 'about' URI

     Assignment Notes:  OPTIONAL field.  Any additional information
     about the assignment

     Author/Change Controller:  REQUIRED field.  A person or an
     organization, authorized to change this registration, that should
     be contacted for further information on the regsitered 'about' URI,
     with their contact points

   The initial registrations are as given below.

8.2.1. Initial Registrations

   IANA is requested to perform the following initial registrations in
   the created registry:

  a) 'about' URI segment token:  blank

     Intended usage:  the "about:blank" URI returns the blank page

     Resolvable 'about' URI:  yes
