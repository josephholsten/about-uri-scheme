Internet-Draft           The 'about' URI scheme             January 2009


   "about".  About URIs are designed to be an internal, application-
   level identifier.  Unlike many other URI schemes, the resolution of,
   and resources represented by, about URIs are left entirely to each
   individual application.

1.  Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)

   Discussion of this draft should take place on the URI Review mailing
   list (uri-review@ietf.org).

2.  Introduction

   An about URI is designed to be used internally by applications for
   almost any desired purpose.  Such URIs have commonly been used by web
   browsers for providing access to built-in functionality, such as
   application information, preferences, settings, or "easter eggs".

   While any number of existing schemes could be used to identify such
   resources, about URIs have become the de facto standard.  Browsers
   already use the about scheme.  The about:blank (Section 4.1) URI is
   ubiquitous, and some browsers also provide other resources with the
   about scheme, including those in Section 4.2.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  URI Syntax

   The general syntax of a about URI, in ABNF [RFC5234] is:

             abouturi = "about:" segment [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

   where "segment", "query", and "fragment" are imported from [RFC3986].
   About URIs are always escaped, as per [RFC3986].

   In the interests of tractability to humans, about URIs should not be
   minted with percent-encoded parts.  However, the about URI syntax
   does allow percent-encoded characters in the "pchar" elements defined
   in [RFC3986].

   No relative URI syntax is defined.

4.  Resolving About URIs

   In general, applications are free to resolve any about URI to any
   resource, either internal or external, or redirect to an alternative
   URI, with about:blank being the only exception.

   As about URIs are designed to be internal to each application, there
   is no expectation of any URI, except about:blank, returning the same
   resource among different applications.  However, it is worth noting
   that some conventions have arisen for providing particular
   functionality via common about URIs.

   Because about URIs identify application specific information,
   applications should not need to retrieve remote information for such
   a resource.

   The about:blank URI is the only about URI reserved by this
   specification.

4.1.  about:blank

   Applications resolving this URI must return an empty resource, with
   the media type "text/html" and the character encoding "UTF-8".

4.2.  Examples

   The following examples illustrate some known URIs supported by
   existing applications.  They are not guaranteed to be resolvable by
   every application.

   about:config  Commonly provides access to application preferences and
      settings

   about:cache  Commonly provides access to information about resources
      stored in the browsers cache.

   about:plugins  Commonly provides access to information about
      installed plugins

   about:mozilla  An easter egg supported by Mozilla showing a passage
      from the fictional Book of Mozilla

   about:internets  An easter egg supported by Google Chrome depicting
      the internet as a series of tubes.

   Applications are also permitted redirect such URIs.  For example,
   Opera redirects all about: URIs, with the exception of about:blank,
   to the equivalent URI using their internal opera: scheme. e.g. about:
   config redirects to opera:config.

   This is not an exhaustive list.  Many more are supported by numerous
   applications.  For more examples, consult Wikipedia's entry on the
   "about: URI Scheme".

5.  Security Considerations

   There is no guarantee that an application will understand any about
   URI provided to it.  An about URI may not resolve to the expected
   resource.  If the reference is unlikely to resolve correctly, the
   reference should be accompanied by an explanation or alternatives.

   Some applications are known to display arbitrary HTML following the
   scheme.  Applications should be cautious when accessing an about URI.
   An application should not execute or display information in an about
   URI.  About URIs should not cause the application to modify any data.
   Applications should not use about URIs to access, or erase files or
   other sensitive information.

   About URIs may identify resources which show sensitive information.
   This data SHOULD NOT be exposed in about URIs.

   "The origin of the about:blank Document is set when the Document is
   created.  If the new browsing context has a creator browsing context,
   then the origin of the about:blank Document is the origin of the
   creator Document.  Otherwise, the origin of the about:blank Document
   is a globally unique identifier assigned when the new browsing
   context is created."

6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests the IANA permanently register the about
   URI scheme as specified in this document and summarized in the
   following template, per [RFC4395]:

   URI scheme name:  about

   Status:  Provisional

   URI scheme syntax:  See Section 3

   URI scheme semantics:  See Section 2

   Encoding considerations:  Percent-encoding is allowed in 'segment'
      components (see Section 3)

   Intended usage:  See Section 2

   Applications and/or protocols that use this URI scheme name:  Any
      applications that use URIs as identifiers for private resources,
      such as web browsers.

   Interoperability considerations:  Applications are only required to
      support about:blank, and may choose to interpret other about URIs
      differently.  Other about URIs should only be expected to work
      correctly within the same application.

   Security considerations:  See Section 5

   Relevant publications:  None
